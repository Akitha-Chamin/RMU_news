# RMU_news

RMU.news is a fully hand-coded web platform designed to serve as a digital command center for school-wide events and updates. The site brings together announcements, event pages, interactive calendars, countdown timers, and online registration features—allowing students, teachers, and parents to stay informed and connected throughout the school year. RMU.news focuses on a clean, intuitive user experience with responsive layouts and smooth JavaScript-powered interactivity, making it easy to browse upcoming activities, track dates, and register for events.
